		<h1>Seung Ki Lee</h1>
		<h3>
		<div> These are some of the names I go by.</div>
		</h3>
		<h4>
		<div>I was born in the middle of the snow storm on Christmas Eve of 1992. Before I came to study at SMU, I spent my early years in Korea and China. Thanks to this experience I got used to speaking and listening to major eastern asian langauges such as Chinese and Japanese.</div>
		<div>Most of my free time is spent on reading, writing, and learning different skills and knowledge. I love to read Turgenev and Kundera, mostly because of the depth they go into in discovering and portraying whats beneath the human expression. Most of my writing focuses on Problem of Modernity: absence of context, sales of superiority, regressive movements in progressive parties, and hopefully a solid and easy to understand explanation of what I know of Computer Science, Economics, Philosophy, Literature(mostly Russian, 20th Century Europe), and History.</div>
		<div>I also like to learn different languages and instruments. It is my goal to be fluent in Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish by the time I graduate from college. Right as of now I am practicing Saxophone, guiar, and piano in hopes that I will compose 3 songs by the end of senior year. </div>

		<h4>
		<div>I came to SMU on the fall of 2011, hoping to major in Finance and Economics. I joined business fraterniities and studided economics.</div>

		<div>After my first year at SMU, I had to return to South Korea for my mandatory military service conscription. I signed up to be the army interpreter between USFK and ROK army.</div>
		<div>After the basic training and boot camp, I was allocated to the Korean Army Academy at YeongCheon (KAAY), which serves as the Westpoint of South Korea.
		Little did I know that my career as interpreter will be as spectacle as it was. As an interpreter I was expecting at least a desk to work on all the translations or field work with the USFK.</div>
		<div>However what welcomed me was the greatest and worst shortage of manpower the base has ever seen. As an institute training and educating future officiers, the base required various kinds of instructor's assistants such as personal and formational fire-arms, ranger's training, chemical warfare, and even cooks. As a newly allocated private at the bottom of the rank, I was automatically signed up for any and all jobs experiencing this shortage.
		Instead of translating classfied documents and translating, I instead learnt how to disassemble and reassemble m16a1 in less then 18 seconds. At one point I was teachign a squad of officers about phospherous grenade, and got to shoot the Rambo gun, jumped out of a helicopter for airbone training, at one point I even cooked rice for 1200 people. Then, when everything was getting easy, I was done with my service.</div>

		<h3>
		<div>I essentially started out progamming in C++ on the summer of my sophomore year of college. Yes, technically Java was my first programming language but in all honesty, I would not have made it through the course without help of my friends. Then I had to get into assembly language which literally was harder than Chinese to learn.</div>
		<div>Learning differnt programming language is as interesting and difficult as learning a new spoken language: it opens up a new world of thoughts and ways and provide means of communication, at the same time sinks you in a pool of rules and restrictions as they seemingly detonate in your face. Only after you've mastered the art and craft you realize the burdensome rules are on your shoulders as a wing, and it is there to help you solve a problem. I hope to learn the trend and future of the programming languages, have more practice and be comfortable with other programming languages.
